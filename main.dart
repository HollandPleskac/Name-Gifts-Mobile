// NOTE ON ALT UID
// - this uid is used to store either a copy of the uid of the user or
//   the uid of the person hosting a shared event (such as if the user is invited to a family)
// - using this uid allows a user in a shared event to commit to the right part of the database
// - the alt uid can also be a copy of the user uid
// - processes in the app that involve adding stuff (members / events) to database
//   use that alt uid
